# MediaVault
MediaVault is a feature-rich, secure, and scalable cloud storage solution inspired by Google Drive but engineered with a modern, microservices-based architecture. This project serves as a practical exploration of advanced software engineering principles, from distributed systems design to cloud-native deployment and DevOps practices.
